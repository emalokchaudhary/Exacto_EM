This is to advise that on the above date we carried out a visual inspection from decklevel of the following tanks: P3, Slop P, Slop S.
From such visual inspection, and from information as supplied by ship's officers, we consider that said tanks are substantially suitable to load the
nominated cargo.

Whilst every effort has been made to comply with tank inspection instructions we cannot be held responsible for those areas beyond visual
inspection (such as pumps, lines) and/or the effectiveness of advised tank cleaning methods.

Note: Due to the nature of the cargo to be loaded and the previous cargo(es) carried by the vessel, commencement of loading this cargo is
depending on permission obtained from the principal(s). It may be necessary that 'First Foot' samples are drawn and checked for quality.

~ Due to restrictions enforced by terminal/refinery/vessels management and/or local laws and regulations, samples of concerned object have
been taken via a closed/restricted sampling system.
With reference to API MPMS 12.11 it should be noted that when taking vessel samples, it may not be possible to obtain representative
samples of nonhomogeneous cargoes due to the inherent nature of the cargo and the sampling restrictions.
