Remarks:
      Samples retained by Saybolt will be held for 90 days (unless otherwise specified) at the end of which they shall be disposed of.
      Due to restrictions enforced by terminal/refinery/vessels management and/or
      local laws and regulations, samples of concerned object have been taken via a
      closed/restricted sampling system.With reference to API MPMS 12.11 it
      should be noted that when taking vessel samples, it may not be possible to
      obtain representative samples of nonhomogeneous cargoes due to the inherent nature of the cargo and the sampling restrictions.

    Dear Sirs,

    As appointed surveyors for the above mentioned assignment, we are instructed by our principal(s) to take samples of Vessel cargo tanks via
    the open hatch procedure discharge.
    Opening of the tank hatches is not allowed due to the following reason(s):
                    1. General terminal regulations
                    2. General ship's policy

    Consequently, we are obliged to obtain samples .

    We trust that the vapour lock, ship's circulation lines and sampling points are clean and/or appropriate for sampling of the above mentioned
    cargo. Saybolt can not be held responsible for those areas beyond visual inspection and/or the effectiveness of the cleaning methods.

    Please be informed that if aforesaid procedure would results in off spec analysis, we will reject all responsibility for any extra costs, such as
    costs for re-sampling and re-analyzing, delays or other detrimental consequences.

    Furthermore, on behalf of our principals, we reserve the right to revert to this matter at a later date.

    Signature of this document is acknowledged of receipt only and is not an admission of responsibility for the incident.
