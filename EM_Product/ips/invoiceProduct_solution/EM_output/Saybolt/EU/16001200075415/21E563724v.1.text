            Description: Vessel Composite BTT Testing
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.

Load / Discharge Instructions:
For sampling and sealing, below instructions must be followed:
1) Invite the owners to witness the sampling of the manifold (arm loading "beginning")/ship tanks
2) Jointly seal and label the samples
3) Issue the samples document and have it signed by the ship crew showing samples are drawn in the presence of both par-
ties

Attn Inspector: If you cannot draw sample yourself, do accompany and witness the site operators when samples are drawn.

Parcel Comments:
Retain samples for 90 days.

Quality Inspection Instructions:
SET 1
            Description: On-shore tank Sample
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
A 1-L retain sample of the on-shore tank, which is sealed and kept either at the loading site, or by the Surveyor.
When the tank has no specific protection device against the ingress of atmospheric humidity, a low level (i.e. tank outlet level)
sample is taken and confirmed B&C.

            Description: Loading arm beginning sample
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
A 0.5 to 1-L loading arm "beginning" retain sample taken during the loading, preferably when 5 to 15% of the basestock is
transferred.

            Description: Vessel Composite BTT Testing
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.

Load / Discharge Instructions:
For sampling and sealing, below instructions must be followed:
1) Invite the owners to witness the sampling of the manifold (arm loading "beginning")/ship tanks
2) Jointly seal and label the samples
3) Issue the samples document and have it signed by the ship crew showing samples are drawn in the presence of both par-
ties

Attn Inspector: If you cannot draw sample yourself, do accompany and witness the site operators when samples are drawn.

Parcel Comments:
Retain samples for 90 days.

Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.

Load / Discharge Instructions:
For sampling and sealing, below instructions must be followed:
1) Invite the owners to witness the sampling of the manifold (arm loading "beginning")/ship tanks
2) Jointly seal and label the samples
3) Issue the samples document and have it signed by the ship crew showing samples are drawn in the presence of both par-
ties

Attn Inspector: If you cannot draw sample yourself, do accompany and witness the site operators when samples are drawn.

Parcel Comments:
Retain samples for 90 days.

Load / Discharge Instructions:
For sampling and sealing, below instructions must be followed:
1) Invite the owners to witness the sampling of the manifold (arm loading "beginning")/ship tanks
2) Jointly seal and label the samples
3) Issue the samples document and have it signed by the ship crew showing samples are drawn in the presence of both par-
ties

Attn Inspector: If you cannot draw sample yourself, do accompany and witness the site operators when samples are drawn.

Parcel Comments:
Retain samples for 90 days.

            Description: Vessel Composite BTT Testing
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.

Load / Discharge Instructions:
For sampling and sealing, below instructions must be followed:
1) Invite the owners to witness the sampling of the manifold (arm loading "beginning")/ship tanks
2) Jointly seal and label the samples
3) Issue the samples document and have it signed by the ship crew showing samples are drawn in the presence of both par-
ties

Attn Inspector: If you cannot draw sample yourself, do accompany and witness the site operators when samples are drawn.

Parcel Comments:
Retain samples for 90 days.

A 1-L retain sample of the on-shore tank, which is sealed and kept either at the loading site, or by the Surveyor.
When the tank has no specific protection device against the ingress of atmospheric humidity, a low level (i.e. tank outlet level)
sample is taken and confirmed B&C.

Quality Test Comments:
A 0.5 to 1-L loading arm "beginning" retain sample taken during the loading, preferably when 5 to 15% of the basestock is
transferred.
This sample is labeled distinctly from the first one, sealed and stored by the surveyor.

            Description: Vessel Composite BTT Testing
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.

SET 6
            Description: Vessel Composite BTT Testing
       Sample Location: Other (Specify in Comments)
Quality Test Comments:

If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.
