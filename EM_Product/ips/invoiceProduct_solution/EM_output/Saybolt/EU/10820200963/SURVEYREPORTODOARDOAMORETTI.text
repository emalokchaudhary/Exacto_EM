We were unable to carry out a visual tank inspection due to the fact that the cargo tanks were inerted. The suitability for vessels cargotank 3 Port, 3
Stbd, 7 Port, 7 Stbd remains therefore at Owners responsibility.

Note: Due to the nature of the cargo to be loaded and the previous cargo(es) carried by the vessel, commencement of loading this cargo is
depending on permission obtained from the principal(s). It may be necessary that the 'First foot' samples are drawn and checked for quality.

Whilst every effort has been made to comply with tank inspection instructions we can not be held responsible for the effectiveness of advised tank
cleaning methods.
