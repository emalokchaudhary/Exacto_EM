sample is taken and confirmed B&C.

Quality Test Comments:
If all compartment samples are tested OK for appearance and odour, an average of each grade loaded is made from the
running samples and divided into four.
The 3 other samples (1L) are labeled and sealed as retain samples. One is kept by the Surveyor, one given to the vessel Offi-
cer, one to the EM loading site. One sample (0.5 to 1 L) is analyzed according to the list of Bulk Transfer Tests as indicated in
ProMIS requirements.
/!\ Important: The ship's departure is only allowed if the grade composite meets EM ProMIS requirements for Bulk Transfer
Tests, or a waiver has been granted.
