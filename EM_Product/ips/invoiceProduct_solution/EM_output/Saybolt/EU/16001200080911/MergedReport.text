~ Due to restrictions enforced by terminal/refinery/vessels management and/or local laws and regulations, samples of concerned object have
been taken via a closed/restricted sampling system.
With reference to API MPMS 12.11 it should be noted that when taking vessel samples, it may not be possible to obtain representative
samples of nonhomogeneous cargoes due to the inherent nature of the cargo and the sampling restrictions.
