  Remarks:
        The sample mixing procedure was performed in accordance with the procedures specified in practice ASTM D 5854 (API
  1
        Chapter 8.3). The temperature of the sample before mixing 12 °C, the temperature of the sample after mixing 13 °C.




  ~ Due to restrictions enforced by terminal/refinery/vessels management and/or local laws and regulations, samples of concerned object have
  been taken via a closed/restricted sampling system.
  With reference to API MPMS 12.11 it should be noted that when taking vessel samples, it may not be possible to obtain representative
  samples of nonhomogeneous cargoes due to the inherent nature of the cargo and the sampling restrictions.
