           There was product observed through each compartment's sightglass, but there was no product found
           at the gauge points. The OBQ quantity is calculated from the lowest volume in each compartment.

           Line Displacement waived, due to flare controls possibly resetting and delaying the transfer.

   Accordingly, we are holding your terminal, operators, and other interested parties responsible for the loss and damage thereby
   sustained, as well as any consequential loss and damage arising therefrom. Will you kindly acknowledge receipt on the copy
   thereof and return to us. The signatures thus obtained are for receipt only and in no way acknowledge responsibility for the
