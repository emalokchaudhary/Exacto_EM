The cargo(es) listed above may contain different levels of H2S, including levels that could result in
serious injury or death. Vessel operator should take the appropriate
precautions to protect their crews from exposure to H2S. Information about H2S levels should be dis-
cussed with the terminal operator before loading. MSDS and shore
tank specific H2S information should be obtained during the pre-transfer conference.

                         Tank Composite (Running)
Quality Test Comments:
Prior to vessel arrival, verify temperature of on-shore tank is between 50-149 degF for EHC 45.    If
shore tank temperature is not within this range, contact scheduler to determine corrective action.
Arrange to pull (1) liter (clear) sample from each on-shore tank for field appearance test and retain.
The shore tank appearance test should be conducted at ambient temperature. If any shore tank sample
fails appearance test, contact scheduler to determine corrective action. The shore tank composite sam-
ples should be readily available during vessel conveyance for field visual comparison purposes.

During vessel conveyance, arrange to pull (1) liter (clear) samples from each location specified below
for field appearance test and retain. Field appearance testing for these sample points is not required
to be conducted at room temperature. Compare each sample with the on-shore tank sample(s). If any sam-
ple fails appearance test or color is markedly different from on-shore tank sample(s), please flush
through sample valve until sample is C&B. If subsequent sample is not C&B, contact scheduler to deter-
mine corrective action.
* Shore Line Grab Sample - Once the on-shore manifold or loading arm is filled with basestock, sample as
close to vessel manifold valve as possible.
* Vessel's Manifold at Start of Load - Once the vessel manifold is filled with basestock, sample at the
vessel manifold.
* Ship's First Foot Sample - Once the vessel tank reaches one-foot, sample the compartment.

After the loading, arrange to pull one (1/2 to 1) quart sample of each compartment for visual appearance
test. Appearance testing for the compartment samples is not required to be conducted at ambient temper-
ature. If any compartment sample is abnormal, contact scheduler to determine corrective action.

Quality Test Comments:
Generate (4) composite (1) quart (clear) samples from the compartment samples. (3) Three samples are
retains. (1) One sample is to be delivered to the inspector lab for Bulk Transfer Testing (BTT).
Please be sure to affix the proper hazard warning labels on all samples.

Inspector Lab: Please test the composite compartment samples for the listed tests. If any of the BTT
tests fail, contact the Scheduler immediately. The vessel may be released before the BTT testing is
complete:

* KV 100 must be within +/- 2% of the value reported on CoA.
* Appearance must be C&B (Clear & Bright) at ambient temperature. There must be NO free water. Particle
count not to exceed 5 max and no abnormal odor.
* ASTM D1500 color must be within (CoA +/- 4). ASTM D6045 is an acceptable alternative test method for
color.

to be conducted at room temperature. Compare each sample with the on-shore tank sample(s). If any sam-
ple fails appearance test or color is markedly different from on-shore tank sample(s), please flush
through sample valve until sample is C&B. If subsequent sample is not C&B, contact scheduler to deter-
mine corrective action.
* Shore Line Grab Sample - Once the on-shore manifold or loading arm is filled with basestock, sample as
close to vessel manifold valve as possible.
* Vessel's Manifold at Start of Load - Once the vessel manifold is filled with basestock, sample at the
vessel manifold.
* Ship's First Foot Sample - Once the vessel tank reaches one-foot, sample the compartment.

After the loading, arrange to pull one (1/2 to 1) quart sample of each compartment for visual appearance
test. Appearance testing for the compartment samples is not required to be conducted at ambient temper-
ature. If any compartment sample is abnormal, contact scheduler to determine corrective action.

            Description: Vessel Composite BTT
       Sample Location: Vessel Volumetric Composite after Loading
Quality Test Comments:
Generate (4) composite (1) quart (clear) samples from the compartment samples. (3) Three samples are
retains. (1) One sample is to be delivered to the inspector lab for Bulk Transfer Testing (BTT).
Please be sure to affix the proper hazard warning labels on all samples.

Inspector Lab: Please test the composite compartment samples for the listed tests. If any of the BTT
tests fail, contact the Scheduler immediately. The vessel may be released before the BTT testing is
complete:

* KV 100 must be within +/- 2% of the value reported on CoA.
* Appearance must be C&B (Clear & Bright) at ambient temperature. There must be NO free water. Particle
count not to exceed 5 max and no abnormal odor.
* ASTM D1500 color must be within (CoA +/- 4). ASTM D6045 is an acceptable alternative test method for
color.
