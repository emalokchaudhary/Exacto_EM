to be conducted at room temperature. Compare each sample with the on-shore tank sample(s). If any sam-
ple fails appearance test or color is markedly different from on-shore tank sample(s), please flush
through sample valve until sample is C&B. If subsequent sample is not C&B, contact scheduler to deter-
mine corrective action.
* Shore Line Grab Sample - Once the on-shore manifold or loading arm is filled with basestock, sample as
close to vessel manifold valve as possible.
* Vessel's Manifold at Start of Load - Once the vessel manifold is filled with basestock, sample at the
vessel manifold.
* Ship's First Foot Sample - Once the vessel tank reaches one-foot, sample the compartment.

After the loading, arrange to pull one (1/2 to 1) quart sample of each compartment for visual appearance
test. Appearance testing for the compartment samples is not required to be conducted at ambient temper-
ature. If any compartment sample is abnormal, contact scheduler to determine corrective action.

            Description: Vessel Composite BTT
       Sample Location: Vessel Volumetric Composite after Loading
Quality Test Comments:
Generate (4) composite (1) quart (clear) samples from the compartment samples. (3) Three samples are
retains. (1) One sample is to be delivered to the inspector lab for Bulk Transfer Testing (BTT).
Please be sure to affix the proper hazard warning labels on all samples.

Inspector Lab: Please test the composite compartment samples for the listed tests. If any of the BTT
tests fail, contact the Scheduler immediately. The vessel may be released before the BTT testing is
complete:

* KV 100 must be within +/- 2% of the value reported on CoA.
* Appearance must be C&B (Clear & Bright) at ambient temperature. There must be NO free water. Particle
count not to exceed 5 max and no abnormal odor.
* ASTM D1500 color must be within (CoA +/- 4). ASTM D6045 is an acceptable alternative test method for
color.
